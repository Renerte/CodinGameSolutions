# CodinGameSolutions
These are my solutions to [CodinGame](http://codingame.com) puzzles made in Go. Informations about non-Go solutions are below "Available Solutions"

###Available solutions:
* Onboarding (onboarding.go)
* Power of Thor (powerofthor.go)
* ASCII Art (ascii.go)
* Chuck Norris (chuck.go)
* MIME Type (mimetype.go)
* Defibrillators (defibrillators.go)
* Horse-racing Duals (horses.go)

###Redoing queue:
####Easy:
* The Descent
* Skynet: the Chasm
* Temperatures
* Mars Lander - Level 1 (that will take some time)

####Medium:
* APU: Init Phase
* Skynet: the Virus
* Heat Detector
* The Paranoid Android

> As you see, there's a lot for me to cover as far as my old (non-Go) solutions go. Now I'm mostly completing other challenges, but I will for sure redo each of solutions above.

Thanks for visiting this repo :)
